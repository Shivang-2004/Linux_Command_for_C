Copy paste this script in your texteditor and save it with <name>.sh (ubuntu)

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a C file is provided as an argument
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <your_c_program.c>"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract the filename without the extension
filename=$(basename "$1" .c)

# Compile the C program with necessary libraries
gcc -o "$filename" "$1" -lm  # Example: -lm for math library, add more as needed

# Check if compilation was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Compilation successful. Executing $filename..."
    # Execute the compiled file
    "./$filename"
else
    echo "Compilation failed."
fi

Afther that give it the permission to execute 
chmod +x <name>.sh

./<name>.sh your_c_program.c
